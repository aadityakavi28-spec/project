## 🎯 QUICK START FOR TESTING

### **Fastest Way to Test**

3. Automatically logged in and redirected to dashboard

4. Click **Profile** to see role permissions

## ⚙️ PRODUCTION NOTES

If you want to use the real backend API instead of mock auth:

1. The system **automatically tries API first**
2. Falls back to mock if API is unavailable
3. Simply ensure your backend has:
   - `POST /api/auth/login` endpoint
   - `POST /api/auth/register` endpoint
   - Returns `{ token, user }`

---

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Can't Login?**
- Check email and password exactly (case-sensitive)
- Try quick login buttons first
- Check browser console for errors (F12)

### **Session Not Persisting?**
- Check browser localStorage enabled
- Clear cache if needed
- Check browser privacy settings

### **Protected Routes Not Working?**
- Ensure you're logged in first
- Check PrivateRoute component
- Verify token in localStorage

### **Role Badges Not Showing?**
- Refresh the page
- Check user role in localStorage
- Logout and login again
